# n2yo
A rust application that queries the n2yo.com site for satellite position and stores it to file as JSON.

On my system, the config file can be found under
```~/.config/n2yo/config.toml```. From what I can gather from the documentation
of directories, the location changes depending on OS, distribution etc.

Below is an example config.

``` toml
schema = "https"
host = "api.n2yo.com"
base_url = "/rest/v1/satellite"
observer_lat = ""                   // Latitude you either find on the site or choose yourself.
observer_lon = ""                   // Longitude you either find on the site or choose yourself.
observer_alt = ""                   // Altitude over the sea level found on the site or choose yourself.
key = ""                            // The key generated by the site. Found under user settings or something like that.
timeout = 10                        // The number of seconds the site has to respond before the program errors and quit.
datadir = "/tmp"                    // The directory to store the resulting file in.
sleep = 300                         // The time in seconds between each request.
```

If you execute the app with an ID which does not exist, the following will
happen.

``` bash
hamartin@Vogon:~/Devel/rust/n2yo/src$ cargo run -- --id 123454354544
